This year, I stepped into the Senior Software Engineering Manager role leading the Rebates, Sharing, and Guarantees platforms—highly complex and financially critical systems with long-standing stability challenges and significant technical debt. From day one, I focused on building resiliency, restoring confidence, and driving operational excellence. I inherited an environment with frequent production issues, limited observability, inconsistent processes, and heavy reliance on manual intervention. I worked tirelessly to stabilize the ecosystem by improving our incident triage approach, elevating engineering rigor, enhancing logging and monitoring, and establishing structured priorities around defect reduction and reliability. I strengthened collaboration between engineering, QA, product, operations, and business partners, enabling more predictable delivery and reducing reactive firefighting. I also emphasized team development and clarity of ownership, mentoring engineers to build deeper domain expertise and encouraging accountability and transparency across workstreams. These improvements have meaningfully reduced operational burden, increased confidence in delivery, and enabled us to shift focus from short-term fixes toward long-term transformation. For the business, these changes directly impact accuracy of financial settlement, client experience, and risk mitigation, supporting more stable processing and reliable execution of contractual commitments. At the company level, strengthening the technical foundation of these systems supports broader goals around operational efficiency, scalability, automation, and readiness for future innovation, including analytics and AI-driven modernization. While there is still significant transformation ahead, the progress made this year has laid critical groundwork to reduce systemic risk, improve resiliency, and elevate engineering culture. I am proud of the dedication and resilience of the team during this transition and remain fully committed to delivering consistent performance, eliminating technical debt, and building strong, durable systems that enable growth and long-term success for Evernorth and Cigna.
