Looking ahead, my main development focus is strengthening the foundation of the Rebates, Sharing, and Guarantees platforms, especially since these systems are legacy, complex, and have very limited subject-matter expertise available today. One of my priorities is to build deeper system knowledge within the team by creating structured documentation, cross-training plans, and SME development pathways so we are not dependent on only a few individuals. I also plan to formalize and improve engineering standards and SDLC practices for these platforms, since many processes have evolved informally over time. Establishing clearer expectations around design reviews, testing strategy, deployment readiness, monitoring, and observability will help increase consistency and quality across releases. Another key development focus is continuing to identify and eliminate technical debt so we can move from reactive problem-solving to proactive modernization. This includes strengthening architectural planning, improving long-term capacity and performance, and reducing operational overhead. These efforts will help the team move faster with more confidence, reduce risk, and position us for scalable modernization and future innovation. I’m committed to growing as a leader by improving long-term strategy thinking, influencing across teams, and driving sustainable change—not just short-term fixes.
