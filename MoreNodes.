In the earlier version of Savings Advisor, the system was tightly coupled with individual products. 
This meant that each time a new product was introduced, a significant amount of engineering effort was required to integrate it. 
The logic, presentation, and data handling were all product-specific, resulting in repetitive work, longer onboarding cycles, and reduced flexibility.

With the introduction of the DISC framework, we are transitioning from a product-oriented model to a choice-oriented framework. 
The key idea is to decouple product logic from the Savings Advisor core and move that logic into dedicated Product APIs.
This abstraction allows DISC to remain stable and reusable even as new products are onboarded.

In the choice-oriented framework, users are presented with all possible savings choices available for a given opportunity—such 
as brand-to-generic, 90-day supply, or pharmacy switch—regardless of which product they are currently enrolled in. 
These choices are standardized across all products, ensuring a consistent experience, simpler onboarding, and reduced maintenance overhead.


This modernization makes Savings Advisor more scalable, maintainable, and future-ready as new savings programs and products are introduced.


Now let me walk you through how this works in practice with a quick demo.

When a user lands on the Savings Advisor landing screen, they see two main cards. 
The first card displays details about their last fill—showing where they filled their most recent prescription, how much it cost,
and what their cost would be if they continued with the same pharmacy, based on their current deductible phase and at what fill they are on.

On the right side, the system displays the available savings choices for that opportunity. For example, if the user’s last fill was at a non-contracted pharmacy, the system recommends switching to a contracted pharmacy as a savings option. If the user is currently filling a 30-day supply, we may recommend moving to a 90-day fill for better savings. Similarly, if a generic alternative is available, the system presents that as a recommended switch option.

Below these cards, users can easily compare and see how much they would save if they choose one of the recommended options.
