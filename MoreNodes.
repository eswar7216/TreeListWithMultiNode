Got it 👍 — here’s a more casual version you can send to leadership. It keeps the same core points, but in a friendlier, easy-to-read tone without all the heavy business jargon:

Subject: Proposal – AI Webex Support Bot

Hi [Leader’s Name],

I wanted to share an idea that can really cut down the time and effort our team is spending on Webex support. Right now, when users run into issues like login failures, password resets, or missing welcome emails, it takes our support managers and developers anywhere from 2–3 hours to dig through logs and fix things manually. With ~30–50 of these requests coming in each month, that’s a big chunk of time going into repetitive work.

Here’s the proposal:
We use an AI-powered bot that can automatically detect the intent of incoming support requests and either suggest the right fix or even resolve them on its own.

What this means for us:
	•	Time savings: About 60–100 hours per month freed up.
	•	Cost savings: Roughly $6K–$10K/month in productivity value.
	•	Faster fixes: Issues that used to take hours can be solved in minutes.
	•	Happier developers: Less time lost on manual checks, more focus on delivery and innovation.
	•	Scales easily: As requests grow, we won’t need to add more people just to handle them.

Next steps:
We’d start with a pilot focusing on the top recurring issues (logins, password resets, welcome emails). From there, we can measure hours saved, resolution speed, and overall impact before expanding further.

In short: this is a quick win that saves us time, money, and makes life easier for both our support team and our developers.

Would love your go-ahead to move this forward.

Thanks,
Eswar

Do you want me to also make this into a short slide deck (3–4 slides) so you can present it quickly in a leadership sync?
