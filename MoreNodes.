Over the past year, stepping into the Senior Software Engineering Manager role for Rebates, Sharing, and Guarantees, I focused heavily on leading by example and building trust—especially during a time when the team was dealing with a lot of instability, tech debt, and pressure. I stayed calm and transparent through challenges, owned problems instead of pointing fingers, and encouraged the team to speak openly about issues and solutions. I worked closely with everyone to reset priorities, improve communication, and bring more structure to the way we plan, troubleshoot, and deliver work. I put a strong emphasis on supporting the team’s growth, helping individuals develop confidence and deeper understanding of our systems so they could take more ownership. Across teams, I partnered with product, operations, and business owners to make sure we’re aligned on the right problems and not just reacting. These changes have helped reduce chaos, improve engagement, and shift us toward more stable systems and predictable delivery. There’s still a lot to do, but I’m proud of how far we’ve come together and I’m committed to continuing to build a resilient, collaborative, and accountable culture.
