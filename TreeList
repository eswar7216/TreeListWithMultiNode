Sure! Here's a line-by-line explanation of the simplified loadCssInternal function:

Code Explanation
javascript
Copy code
const loadCssInternal = (location, isCobrand = false, isClient = false) => {
Purpose: This function loads a CSS file into the <head> section of the HTML document.
Parameters:
location: The URL or path to the CSS file.
isCobrand: A boolean indicating if the file is the cobrand stylesheet (defaults to false).
isClient: A boolean indicating if the file is the client stylesheet (defaults to false).
javascript
Copy code
    const head = document.getElementsByTagName('head')[0];
Purpose: Retrieves the <head> element of the document, where the CSS files will be inserted.
Result: head now refers to the <head> tag in the DOM.
javascript
Copy code
    const styles = document.createElement('link');
Purpose: Creates a new <link> element, which will be used to load the CSS file.
Result: styles is now a <link> element that will later be configured and added to the <head>.
javascript
Copy code
    styles.href = location;
    styles.rel = 'stylesheet';
Purpose: Sets the href attribute to the URL/path of the CSS file and defines the rel attribute as "stylesheet".
Result: The <link> element (styles) is now configured to point to the CSS file.
javascript
Copy code
    const elementId = isClient ? 'clientId' : isCobrand ? 'cobrandId' : uuid.v4();
    styles.id = elementId;
Purpose: Determines the id for the <link> element based on the type of CSS file.
If isClient is true, the id is set to "clientId".
If isCobrand is true, the id is set to "cobrandId".
If neither is true, a unique ID is generated using uuid.v4().
Result: The <link> element now has a specific id, which is used to manage its position in the <head>.
javascript
Copy code
    return new Promise((resolve) => {
Purpose: The function returns a Promise that will resolve when the stylesheet is successfully loaded.
Result: Allows asynchronous handling of the CSS loading process, useful for ensuring styles are applied before proceeding.
javascript
Copy code
        styles.addEventListener('load', () => resolve(elementId), false);
Purpose: Adds an event listener to the <link> element that listens for the load event, which fires when the CSS file is fully loaded.
Action: When the file is loaded, the promise resolves with the elementId, indicating successful loading.
javascript
Copy code
        const clientStyles = document.getElementById('clientId');
        const cobrandStyles = document.getElementById('cobrandId');
Purpose: Checks if there are already elements with the id of "clientId" or "cobrandId" in the document.
Result: clientStyles and cobrandStyles will refer to the existing elements, if they are found.
javascript
Copy code
        if (isClient) {
Purpose: Checks if the file being loaded is the client stylesheet (isClient is true).
javascript
Copy code
            clientStyles ? clientStyles.replaceWith(styles) : head.appendChild(styles);
Purpose: If clientStyles already exists in the document, it is replaced with the new styles element.
Action: If clientStyles does not exist, the new styles element is appended to the end of the <head>.
javascript
Copy code
        } else if (isCobrand) {
Purpose: If the file is the cobrand stylesheet (isCobrand is true), this block is executed.
javascript
Copy code
            cobrandStyles ? cobrandStyles.replaceWith(styles) : (clientStyles ? clientStyles.before(styles) : head.appendChild(styles));
Purpose:
If cobrandStyles already exists, it is replaced with the new styles element.
If clientStyles exists but cobrandStyles does not, the new styles element is inserted before clientStyles.
If neither exists, the new styles element is appended to the end of the <head>.
javascript
Copy code
        } else {
Purpose: This block handles the case where the file is neither the client nor the cobrand stylesheet (i.e., any other CSS file).
javascript
Copy code
            cobrandStyles ? cobrandStyles.before(styles) : (clientStyles ? clientStyles.before(styles) : head.appendChild(styles));
Purpose:
If cobrandStyles exists, the new styles element is inserted before it.
If cobrandStyles does not exist but clientStyles does, the new styles element is inserted before clientStyles.
If neither exists, the new styles element is appended to the end of the <head>.
javascript
Copy code
    });
};
Purpose: Closes the promise and the function.
Result: The function returns a Promise that resolves once the CSS file is loaded, ensuring that the CSS file is loaded in the correct order in the DOM.
Summary
Order Enforcement: This function ensures that the client stylesheet (clientId) is always the last in the <head>, the cobrand stylesheet (cobrandId) is the second to last, and all other stylesheets are loaded before them.
Simplicity: The function is designed to be readable and easy to maintain while handling the specific requirements for stylesheet loading order.
